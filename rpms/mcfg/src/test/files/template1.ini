[ckan.ini]    ;; a target (just a descriptive name)

;; mcfg_filename is a mandatory special parameter specifying the filename 
;; of the target to the mcfg tool
mcfg_filename: /home/ckan/pyenv/src/development.ini

;; All other parameters list the editors needed for this target.
;; The same parameter must also occur in the mcfg file, otherwise the 
;; mcfg is incomplete and should not pass pre-installation test (R7).
;;
;; The exact meaning of the paramater name is editor specific, but generally
;; it somehow denotes the item the editor has to edit inside the target.
;;
;; The value is
;;     - an integer: for increment control (when this editor needs to
;;                   be run)
;;     - a space as separator
;;     - the name of the editor function

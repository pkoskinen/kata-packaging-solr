    """Idea: call the same command repetitively to work through a list of
    actions. The whole list gets completed incrementally.
    Each action has numerical attribute, that shows in which increment
    the action needs to be performed.
    Increment numbers don't need to be match exactly, they are treated
    as intervals.

    Example:
        list: [(a1, 5), (a2, 10), (a3, 20)]

        (This list is used only to show the concept. No such data structure
        exists in the class.)

    Invocation example 1:

        command(10)  # will invoke actions a1 and a2
        command(25)  # will invoke action a3

    Invocation example 2:

         command(7)  # will invoke action a1
         command(9)  # will not invoke any action
         command(50) # will inoke actions a2 and a3
